This resulted in a loss of cabin pressure that rendered the pilot and passenger unconscious during cruise flight and eventually led to an in-flight loss of power due to fuel exhaustion over the open ocean.

The burn-though of the combustion chamber caused downstream hardware to experience higher than designed temperatures that resulted in mechanical and thermal distress to the point that the low pressure turbine case began to melt.  Contributing to the combustion chamber failure was the operators' failure to do recommended borescope inspections that would have detected the combustion chamber distress and hence the removal of the engine before it was allowed to progress to the point that the combustion and turbine sections of the engine failed.

Also causal was the pilots� failure to adequately monitor their instruments and respond to multiple EGPWS warnings to arrest the helicopter�s descent. Contributing to the pilots� decision was external pressure to complete the flight. Contributing to the accident was the pilots� lack of night flying experience from the island and their inadequate crew resource management.

The HCF crack developed as a result of a mechanically coupled LPC stage 3 and stage 1 IBR mode excitation and blade flutter response. The excitation was driven by an acoustic tone generated by turbulent airflow passing over the 2.5 bleed valve duct cavity while the engine was operating at high speeds in specific flight conditions. A primary contributor to the failure mode was an electronic engine control (EEC) software update that changed the LPC vane schedule and increased the likelihood of LPC stage 1 IBR blade flutter onset within the engine operating range.
